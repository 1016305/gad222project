[font_size=30]Weekly check-in! Cargo loading delay of four hours, but nothing out of the ordinary.

The company installed the AI overseer during loading. I've heard from other freighters that these things are either legendary or absolute hell.

The Captain doesn't like it, but then again he wouldn't trust a digital watch to tell the time.

A few new crew members on board. I wish the company still made them watch the training video. The number of times I have to tell these [font_size=20][color=red][REDACTED][color=gray][font_size=30] to stay out of the admin areas is getting ridiculous.

Next two weeks will be spent writing up securities violations and dumping access logs. Yay.
