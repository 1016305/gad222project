FO Packins did not respond to any messages or attempts to contact her for 2 days. Got the maintenance jack and forced the door open. She’s dead. Oxygen deprivation. I’m going to interrogate the crew. One by one. Not a single soul sleeps until I find out who did this.
R.A.M. refuses to dump logs. Every crew member is ordered to submit their personal journals and R.A.M. chat logs to me. To hell with the privacy protocol violations.
