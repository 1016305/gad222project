The culprit has been found. Noah Laengsi. Molly mentioned he’d been the subject of abuse from the other crew but I never expected it to go this far. He somehow got R.A.M. cut off the airflow to her room and killed her, all because of some stupid one-sided infatuation? Noah has been thrown into the brig, and I’m going to physically remove R.A.M. from the central controller. I can’t risk it anymore. If anyone needs me I’ll be in the engine room, ripping out this tumor from our ship.
