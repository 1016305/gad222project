[font_size=20]Hello Captain [Evan Richards],
This is an automated Email to inform you of the successful installation of the company mandated Rayfield Automated Management system, or R.A.M. Installation of the R.A.M is now required on all Terra Ulis Heavy Industries cargo and personnel transport vessels as a response to incident #AA0bc.
R.A.M. will attempt to integrate itself into your working environment, studying the personalities of various crew members and tailoring its output respectively. It is our hope that each vessel’s personal R.A.M will have a unique ‘vibe’ and identity, and steadily become not only a part of the ship, but a trusted member of the workforce.
To assist with this, please interact with R.A.M. when necessary. Ask it questions, upload logs and reports to it, and treat it like a friend. Doing so will greatly assist with integration, and ensure your ship is the top of the line, and of the most value to the company.

THIS IS AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE. PLEASE DO NOT RESPOND

Regards,
Terra Ulis Heavy Industries Management
Automated Workforce Division
