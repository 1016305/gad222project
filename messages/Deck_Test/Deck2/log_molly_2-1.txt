[font_size=30]With the security breaches no longer an issue, I can start profiling the crew.
A lot of newbies aboard and I mean new-newbies. I don’t think any of these kids have ever been off-world. There’s the regular garbage to deal with, bullying, fighting, generalised anxiety about being in space. It takes time for them to get into the headspace. Maybe they should talk with RAM. The company said it might be able to help.
