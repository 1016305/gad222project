this sucks. dad wanted me to get a job so I got a job. can’t get away from being picked on in space either. at least i have my own room out here, so something like peace and quiet.
the pamphlet that the pretty lady who runs the ship gave us says we have to talk to the onboard AI to help it integrate. I wouldn’t mind. its probaby programmed to NOT be a dick to me
