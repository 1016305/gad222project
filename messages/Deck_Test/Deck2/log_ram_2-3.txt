>Incident Report: #a51c
>Notation: Molly Packins
>Description:
>Mess hall was accessed last night using the general access code. Seems one of our new guys didn’t realise chow time is definitive and not a suggestion. He missed out on his meal and broke in to try and dig some scraps from what was left. Set off the alarms in the whole ship.
>Sent him to the brig for 24 hours. Hopefully that’ll help set an example for the others.
>RAM suggests giving each user a unique access code, so that’s what I’ve done.
>Incident closed.
