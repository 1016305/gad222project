[font_size=30]MAN some of these new guys are absolute [font_size=20][color=red][REDACTED][color=gray][font_size=30]. Found that they’re all too tough and stuipid to pick on eachother so they find the weakest kid and start on him.
Luckily they’re too stupid to know I’m not *legally* allowed to throw them out of the airlock, so threats of ‘ejection’ seem to work well… for now.
So much for free time.
Now I have to write up reports on all of them. RAM should be able to help me get it done faster.
