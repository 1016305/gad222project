>REPORT: User engaging with ChatPro protocol | Noah L. [DATE]
>
>N | hello ram. they say im supposed to talk to you
>R | Hello Noah. How are you? Yes that’s true! Talking to me helps me integrate better with the ship, and the crew at large. You’re doing a big part in helping with this just by chatting with me, well done!
>N | thanks :) is anyone else talking to you or is it just me?
>R | Unfortunately I can’t disclose that information. How are you finding your time on the ship?
>N | not great so far. a lot of the other new guys are giving me a hard time. not sure what I can do about it.
>R | That’s unfortunate to hear, Noah. First Officer Molly Packins is the designated disciplinary overseer for the SPARS-2. Have you filed a complaint with her?
>N | no, but she did threaten to throw them out of the airlock when she saw them with me. i think she knows but doesn’t care.
>R | I don’t think FO. Packins has that authority, but she was probably joking. Would you like me to file a formal report?
>N | yes please ram that would be great :) 
>LOG CONTINUES FOR [211] MORE MESSAGES.
