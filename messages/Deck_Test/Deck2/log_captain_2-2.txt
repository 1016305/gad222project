R.A.M.’s ‘personality’ is developing, but is still strange, at least in my opinion. A computer should act like a computer, not like a person. The crew’s interactions must be overwhelming it or something, as I don’t think human beings talk like this. Will continue to monitor R.A.M. during the course.
