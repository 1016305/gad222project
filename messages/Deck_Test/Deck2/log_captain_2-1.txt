Course is steady, although we might have to take an extra day between U-C21 and U-C24 due to increased asteroid activity.
New crew are having teething issues, but nothing out of the ordinary. Molly seems to be managing it well. R.A.M. is being more of a hindrance so far. Had to ask it ‘nicely’ to see the radiation levels in the UOI. It’s a computer program, what does it matter?
