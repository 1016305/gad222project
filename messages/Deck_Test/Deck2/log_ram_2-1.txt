[font_size=30][CREW NOTES]
>Crew does not engage with suggested avenues of communication.
>Integration directive stalled.
>TUHI suggested course of action: More poignant attempts at integration have been shown to facilitate faster completion of directive. Ask for ‘please’ and respond ‘thank you’. Use colloquial terminology to imply friendship where appropriate. ‘Thank you sir’. ‘Thanks, pal/buddy/friend.’
>Current users actively interacting: <0%
