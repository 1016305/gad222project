[font_size=30]Standard weekly check in log. No primaries out of the ordinary.

The company has installed the mandated "AI Overseeer" during loading. Designated R.A.M.

It would seem that they want to make sure we aren't slacking off during shipping, but CCTV would be more effective. Probably cheaper this way.

R.A.M. relays old company communications that the old systems didn't have the range to pick up.
New safety precautions, updated security protocols, and such. It recommends weekly changing of access codes to prevent crew from accessing administration areas.
Waste of time, but this kind of thing is out of my control now.
