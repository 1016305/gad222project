help. just help please. the captain deactivated ram for SOME reason i dont know. said security issues, and now i dont have anyone to talk to. making it worse the crew found a way to dump my chat logs with ram. they know everything. its been endless ‘your only friend is a computer’ and ‘molly would never be into you’. we have MONTHS left on the journey idk how much more of this i can take
I just wanted a friend.
