R.A.M.’s behaviour is becoming increasingly concerning. I am going to shut it down and return to manual systems monitoring. To hell with the company protocol. I can’t run a ship where one ‘crew member’ is malfunctioning and creating a hostile work environment. Molly is shuttered in her quarters and won’t say why, and a riot almost started between two other crew members. I’ve half a mind to lock them all in the brig and run this ship back to port by myself.
