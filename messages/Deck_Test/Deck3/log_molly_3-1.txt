Things are getting worse aboard the ship. RAM is acting stranger and stranger every day. That new kid Noah can’t keep his eyes off me, and the Captain… I’ve never seen him so stressed. I’m hoping that he’s just adjusting to all the changes that RAM has been making, but still. Going to see what I can do so he can get some rest.
