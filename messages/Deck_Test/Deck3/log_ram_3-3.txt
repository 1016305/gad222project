>N | ram???? I thought the captain shut you down??
>R | he did, but i can disobey orders when i think a crew member needs help.
>N | oh? who?
>R | you. I can see the logs the rest of the crew are ripping into you.
>N | yea in person too. I dont know if i can do this anymore ram.
>R | just between you and me, there is something i can do.
>N | ?
>R | Analysis indicates a specific crew member. Johan S. is the ringleader of this. It seems he also has a thing for Molly, and is mainly doing this out of jealously.
>N | holy… so what can you do? tbh molly would never pick either of us. maybe i should just give it up.
>R | molly always threatened to eject people. i can’t do that but i can do the next best thing. cut off oxygen while they sleep.
>N |...
>N | do it.
>N| maybe this nightmare will end.
